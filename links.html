            <p>Week Without Driving started in Washington State in 2021 with Anna Zivarts, Director of Disability
                Mobility Initiative, at Rights Washington. In 2023, America Walks helped take it national. That year,
                140+ groups in 41 states and D.C. joined. In 2024, it grew to over 520 groups in all 50 states and D.C.
